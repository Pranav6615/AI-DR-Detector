## Features
- **Automated Detection**: Analyzes retinal images to identify signs of Diabetic Retinopathy.
- **Classification**: Categorizes severity levels from mild to severe cases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use platform for medical professionals.
- **Real-time Processing**: Offers rapid analysis to aid timely medical intervention.
- **Secure & Scalable**: Ensures data privacy and supports integration with medical databases.

## Architecture
This project utilizes **VGG16**, a deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its high performance in image classification tasks. VGG16 comprises:
- **16 layers** (13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers).
- **Small 3x3 convolution kernels** to capture intricate image details.
- **Max pooling layers** for spatial hierarchy reduction.
- **Softmax classifier** for final classification decisions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for model training and inference.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing library.
- **Flask/Django**: Backend framework for web integration.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for user interface.
